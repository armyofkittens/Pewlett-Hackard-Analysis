# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
This analysis was requested to determine how many employees are retiring from each job title. Furthermore it was requested that data be collected to see which of these employees is eligible for a mentership program. This data can be leveraged in order to set the company up for success once those who are eligible inevitably retire. 

## Results
* The number of eligable retirees exceeds 70,000 employees
* Senior staff (Sr. Engineer and Sr. Staff titles) comprise a vast majority of retirees with over 50,000 of the 70,000+ eligible to retire
* Managers are the least impacted with only two eligible to retire, however Technique Leaders still have over 3000 eligible
* Of the potential retirees, over 1,500 employees are eligible to become mentors

## Summary
* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 72,458 roles will ultimately need t be filled.
* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? Yes and no. While 1500 eligible employees is a good start to train a new generation, ultimately we may need to expand qualifications to meet training and capacity requirements.

### Suggested queries 
* Expand birthdate criterea to people verging on retirement eligibility. This way we are able to meet training demand for the volume of employees necessary to hire. 
* Focus query on most tenure per senior title in order to consult staff with the greatest wealth of knowledge. Perhaps this can be used to create a training program that will help with hiring volumes.
